# Simple Game Image Classifier

This project is focused on building a simple image classification model to identify the game "Mines" using TensorFlow.js. The goal is to create a classifier that can recognize images of the game and categorize them as "Mines" or "Other".

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The model can identify the game "Mines" based on uploaded images.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Utilizes TensorFlow.js for training and inference directly in the browser.
- **Extensible**: Once "Mines" is recognized, we can extend the model to classify other games.

## Steps

### 1. Setup the Environment

- Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
